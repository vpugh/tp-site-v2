				<h3 class="secondary-subtitle">Understanding the Problem</h3>
				<p class="secondary-body">
					Starting with an initial meeting, this is the start of finding out the problem. This is the perfect time to ask questions to better understand the problem and from the source. You can identify if there are other problems or if this is a symptom of a deeper problem. This is a great time gauge if what the client wants isn't what they need.

				<h3 class="secondary-subtitle">Research Extensively <span>If Possible</span></h3>
				<p class="secondary-body">
					Time spent researching is never wasted. It helps guide us toward the next step in the process, it's a crucial step for a good process. We are mapping the various solutions and testing the theories against the data and information we are discovering. We are getting all info in order before starting work on the visuals. This is the perfect time to discuss and research the method of development and deployment for the project. This information is vital to how the content will be created and how it should be structured for the user.

				<h3 class="secondary-subtitle">Sketching, Wireframes &amp; Prototypes</h3>
				<p class="secondary-body">
					Creating simple layouts and ideas on paper is the first step, for me. Pen and pencil gives me the freedom to work dirty and make quick changes. I get my ideas out quick and get a feel faster for their viability. Starting on wireframes is quick work, I like to jump into low-grade prototypes made of HTML. Prototypes give me a better feel of how the layout interacts and is easier to share with others. I can make quicker and more realistic changes to a prototype.

				<h3 class="secondary-subtitle">Development &amp; Deployment</h3>
				<p class="secondary-body">
					With the green-light it's time to start development. From inception, there should have already been an idea of the system to be used in the creation of the project. Whether there is a CMS, a JS framework, or a static page. This decision is instrumental in shaping the visuals and should always be done in the research phase. If this step has been followed correctly, all those decisions already came into play for the design phase and will be easier to implement in coding and deployment.

					Figuring out the information that will shape a sustainable solution is very important to my process. It's a tightrope of strategic planning, careful research, and human-centered design. All design created should be purposeful, not because it looks good or cool and always made with the user in mind.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is a problem when you don't know the user problem or what is valuable to them. Your not making the proper decisions and your project will not benefit your user. Projects that take into account user problems and find ways to bring value have a higher rate of success. The foundation is solid with the intent to engage and attract the user using these factors.
