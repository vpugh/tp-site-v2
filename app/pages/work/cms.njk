					 CDEWorld had a new partnership for their events and I was tasked with creating emails that would advertise their upcoming events. The main task would be to replicate the design and feel of Clinical Mastery while making it an easy email to develop in a short time.

		<p>
			The email content could change based on the stage of the event that was being promoted. With this information in mind I made a simple, non-dynamic base template that would reflect the basic design but leave room to create the different series templates. I manually put in the updated course content and matched the educator to the proper email. Otherwise, it was pretty plug &amp; play.
