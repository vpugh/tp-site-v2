          I'm Tori, a UI/UX Developer. Currently working for Holman Enterprises
          as a Front-End Developer.

        <p>
          I have 8 years experience as a front-end developer and designer. For
          me design is the culmination of conceptualizing and implementing a
          solution, with an understanding of your audience and their needs then
          proceeding to solve problems using critical thinking skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          I use Javascript and React frameworks to develop interactive
          experiences and products. When creating solutions, I always thinking
          about the user first. I keep the balance of good looking UI with user
          experience, usability, and accessibility.
