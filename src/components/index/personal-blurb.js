              Hello, I'm Tori Pugh â€” a Front-End Developer currently working for
              Holman Enterprises. I'm constantly trying to balance the power and
              beauty of design and the practicality and usability of
              development. I strive to make things that look great and work
              equally as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love to learn and also enjoy teaching or speaking about my
              experiences. I give talks at conferences when I can and share some
              content on dribbble when I get a chance.
            </p>
