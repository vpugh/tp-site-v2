Imposter syndrome is that problem that all people, but especially creative people, run into. It’s that feeling that you aren’t good enough and don’t belong where you are. It’s insidious and creeps in so fast that you can’t really prepare for it. When it takes hold of you, and it most likely will, here are somethings you can do to work through it.

## 1. Don’t feel bad, it’s really common

Having these feelings of being inadequate aren’t uncommon. Sometimes your having a bad week and nothing you do seems to pan out. You can get really down on yourself and wonder why your doing any of this at all. Don’t fear! Many people, people of all skill levels, face these problems.

## 2. Don’t let failure get you down

People aren’t perfect from the get go. This means you will run into failure every now and then. Don’t let it derail you or make you feel you can’t do something. Sometimes you need to learn how not to do something to learn how to do it correctly.

> Many of life’s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up. – Thomas Edison

## 3. Look for a mentor

Sometimes these feelings are a literal implication of reaching our limit on our own. It’s hard to push yourself and you might need to seek out a mentor. To find that person who will push when you can’t or wouldn’t push yourself. It’s someone who sees the possibilities that you may be blind to. Going it alone only amplifies these feelings. Being around similar and experienced people will push you that extra mile.

## 4. Share your knowledge

You know you know things, so why not share it. This is a great way to think through all the information you have and build confidence in what your doing. At the same time your teaching others, which is always good. Sometimes the act of sharing unlocks something within us. It can lead to a new passion or a renewed desire in pushing yourself. Interacting with people who want to pick your brain is the reassurance that you need.
