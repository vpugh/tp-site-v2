### Trying Something new

Since I've looked at going freelance, I wanted to make a website that was more professional and would be a good landing page for future clients. After a lot of research and trial and error. I'd come up with a good design. The only issue left was how to build it, my personal portfolio (where you are now), is made with React. For the clients I'm targeting, this seemed like overkill. So I wanted to use something I should offer to them to make the site and I settled on using the no-code site Webflow.

I was apprehensive but after a few videos I was much more open-minded. It may be no-code but that didn't mean it was no skill. It helped me concentrate a lot more on putting a great design together and then worrying a little less about the how and more about the what did I want. So far it's been easy sailing but just learning how to overcome new technology.

### Setting Up The design

To create this design I was intent on working on a library for the design. A layout of all type sizes, colors, and components. Wanted to use Figma to it's greatest power. Using Webflow makes the emphasis on finishing the designs fully before diving into the code even more important. Using React or standard HTML/CSS, I could get more loose with having a design and getting lost in the coding to make adjustments.

I feel to set things up in Webflow requires having a predetermined understanding of how things will relate on the Webflow navigation. I feel less inclined to go offscript and want to get everything as perfect as I can, also because it's easier to do that.

### Work In Progress

Still getting the site ready to go and improving everytime I make a new page. I tihnk this will be a great service to know and is a great way to get some good looking and highly functional websites out on the internet to hopefully replace some of those awful looking sites or Google Doc driven sites I've seen pop up lately.
