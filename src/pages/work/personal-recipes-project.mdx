### The Problem

At the beginning of the pandemic, like many people, I was worried and wanted something to take my mind off of the news and things. Thankfully, my mom was trying to pass time by baking/cooking up a storm. The issue was she kept taking out her files with her recipes and then losing them. I'd always talked about making a system so she could have access to her recipes and save them more securely without a risk of 'misplacing' them.

### The Solution

To create an app, that requires users to sign up and sign in. Then they are able to add recipes to their account and view or edit them from anywhere. This version solves all the important issues that were faced by a physical folder system of paper recipes. Easy access to recipes from anywhere (computer, tablet, etc...) and ability to safely save them.

### Starting Off

Since I'd never done anything this large by myself, as a team I've done some of these steps at work, I'd started at the simplest place, planning. I sat down and wrote down what the base level of success would look like. Then I decided what software I was going to use. If it's something I wasn't comfortable with doing, then I should potentially use things I've never used before.

It took a bit of time but I settled on using React, GraphQL, Heroku, and Auth0. Auth0 came a little later in the process because I originally was writing the backend to login and decided that was a bit too risky for a first time project. Better to stick to something that's easier and guaranteed secure. I did all the login and storing of PII correctly, I hashed with bcrypt and salted the passwords before saving into the account table.

After figuring out the pages that I needed/wanted I started coming up with some designs. I started with something more Dribbble geared, it looked really nice but maybe wasn't the most functional. It then morphed into what I thought made the most sense for how I was using it, with some feedback from my mom (the original intended user).

### Code Journey

Having something to work with I was able to start work on coding. I decided to keep it simple and not use any React frameworks. I could have tried to use Gatsby, Next, or something else. Deciding to keep it simple, I just went with regular React. It's something I'm comfortable with and can use well.

The only real issue I had in my initial implementation was trying to think with a API practicallity but not actually wanting to build and implement that API setup first. Backend architecture isn't my strong point so I'd get lost in a maze of wondering if I did it right and having to go back and forth between the backend and the frontend. Thankfully I'd been seeing something I thought would be perfect for this project, MirageJS. It let's you make mock api calls all on your local system.

Using MirageJS helped me get the UI setup to work with, what I thought at the time, would be the endpoints I would be dealing with. I was able to make all the GETs, PUTs, and PATCHs I thought I would need. Fast-forward to using Hasura to build GraphQL endpoints and database for users, recipes, and settings. This only translated into slight updated from the MirageJS functions but cutdown on implementation by a lot.

### Putting It All Together

Having a functioning UI and GraphQL endpoints, it was all about making sure they worked together while served over netlify. That took a lot of learning and little back and forth with the code to get authentication and tokens to work properly with the GraphQL endpoints. That was one of the hardest things to complete. After that, it was mostly performance enhancement and refactoring the code to streamline things and make it easier to work with in the future.

All in all, it was a success. I've a functional app that I use personally myself, not so much used by my mother :(. I'm struggling with one more issue and then I will release this as a full side-project into the world. I'm storing the token in local-storage and I want to store it as a cookie. This has been one of the most difficult answers to find and I'm still looking. Once that's done, I can make this public and continue to build on new features for it.
