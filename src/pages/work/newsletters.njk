					 CDEWorld had new events and I was tasked with creating emails that would advertise them. This is a collection of various event emails that were produced. The main task would be to replicate the design and feel of the Partner while making it an easy email to develop in a short time.

		<h3 class="subhead">Straumann Event - Fort Lauderdale</h3>
		<p>
			This email series utiulized a simple, non-dynamic template that would reflect the basic company email design but left room to create the different series designed templates. When creating emails rapidly with these needs I created this template. I manually updated the course content for each series.

		<p>
			This was a one-off event and didn't require a deep suite of emails.

			A new partnership for the live events joined and I was responsible for creating emails for their upcoming events. The main task was to replicate the design look and feel of Clinical Mastery Series. From there it was keeping the layout and feel consistency across the multiple pieces they had for the event. Each different course used a different color to signify it's own course branding, this was taken from their promotional materials and website.
